<!--
 The following repositories have caused build failures due to intermittent
 fetch issues.  Since "repo sync" can handle flaky repositories, we add
 them here so that they will be in the source tree.

  <remote  name="chromium"
           fetch="https://chromium.googlesource.com"
           review="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com" />

  <!--
   These repositories do not need to be pinned to a specific commit SHA
   because their ebuilds already pin to a specific commit SHA. We just need
   to make sure that the commit SHA needed by the ebuild is reachable by the
   revision written here (typically the default revision is good enough).
